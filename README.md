# Voltorb Flip

My solution to the NAND2Tetris assignment project #9.

Check out the NAND2Tetris website if you don't know what I am talking about. It's one of the greatest CS courses I know of, I highly recommend taking it.  [*click*](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)

I aimed at creating a game for the Hack-platform that is not only a good demonstration of its capabilities and limitations, but also a fun game to play. Be encouraged to try it for youself.

You can find my original assignment README in the `GUIDE.txt` file -- it's in German, though. Otherwise the most important things are explained in-game.

## How to run

You need a Jack VM emulator. You can get it from www.nand2tetris.org. There may be better, unofficial alternatives. 

I'd recommend [this one](https://funkschy.github.io/nand-to-browser/) -- it runs right in your browser, you'll just have to upload the VM files.

Speaking of VM files.... You have to download the game by zipping or cloning it from this repo and open the `vm` sub-directory in it.

(If you are using the official emulator, turn animations off and you're good to go.)

Dial in your preferred execution speed and press the play button.

This code is not under any license. Feel free to do with it what you want, although it would be nice if you'd not sell it off as yours in your exercises.

Otherwise, feel free to contribute if you like. It's a fun little project.
